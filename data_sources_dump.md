# Primary Energy consumption by source, Countries and Regions
Primary energy consumption is measured in terawatt-hours (TWh). Here an inefficiency factor (the 'substitution'
method) has been applied for fossil fuels, meaning the shares by each energy source give a better approximation of
final energy consumption: takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel
production by converting non-fossil energy into the energy inputs required if they had the same conversion losses as
fossil fuels.

# Per capita primary energy consumption by source, Countries and Regions
Primary energy is calculated based on the 'substitution method' which takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel
production by converting non-fossil energy into the energy inputs required if they had the same conversion losses as
fossil fuels.

# Primary direct energy consumption by source, Countries and Regions
Energy consumption is shown as direct primary energy. This means this does not correct for fossil fuel
inefficiencies in conversion to useful energy estimates.
